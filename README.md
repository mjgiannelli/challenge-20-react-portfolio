  ## [Description](#table-of-contents)

  My project is creating my portfolio with my new found React skills! This portfolio will help me separate myself from the competition and land interviews when applying for jobs.

  I created this project to display my work to potential employers in order to land a job at their company.

  A hiring manager will visit my porfolio, view my projects and determine if I have the skills necessary to land the job at their company. They will also be able to contact me and download my resume.

  ## [Installation](#table-of-contents)
